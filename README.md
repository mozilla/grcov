grcov collects and aggregates code coverage information for multiple source files.
grcov processes .profraw and .gcda files which can be generated from llvm/clang or gcc.
grcov also processes lcov files (for JS coverage) and JaCoCo files (for Java coverage).
Linux, macOS and Windows are supported.

This is a project initiated by Mozilla to gather code coverage results on Firefox.

## How to get grcov

Grcov can be downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/releases) or, if you have Rust installed,
you can run `cargo install grcov`.

## Usage

**Nightly Rust is required** to use grcov for Rust coverage. Alternatively, you can `export
RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`, which basically turns your stable rustc into a Nightly one.

### Example: How to generate source-based coverage for a Rust project

1. Install the llvm-tools or llvm-tools-preview component:

   ```sh
   rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
   ```

2. Ensure that the following environment variable is set up:

   ```sh
   export RUSTFLAGS="-Zinstrument-coverage"
   ```

3. Build your code:

   `cargo build`

4. Ensure each test runs gets its own profile information by defining the LLVM_PROFILE_FILE environment variable (%p will be replaced by the process ID, and %m by the binary signature):

   ```sh
   export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="your_name-%p-%m.profraw"
   ```

5. Run your tests:

   `cargo test`

In the CWD, you will see a `.profraw` file has been generated. This contains the profiling information that grcov will parse, alongside with your binaries.

### Example: How to generate .gcda files for C/C++

Pass `--coverage` to `clang` or `gcc` (or for older gcc versions pass `-ftest-coverage` and `-fprofile-arcs` options (see [gcc docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Data-Files.html)).

### Example: How to generate .gcda files for a Rust project

1. Ensure that the following environment variables are set up:

   ```sh
   export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0
   export RUSTFLAGS="-Zprofile -Ccodegen-units=1 -Copt-level=0 -Clink-dead-code -Coverflow-checks=off -Zpanic_abort_tests -Cpanic=abort"
   export RUSTDOCFLAGS="-Cpanic=abort"
   ```

   These will ensure that things like dead code elimination do not skew the coverage.

2. Build your code:

   `cargo build`

   If you look in `target/debug/deps` dir you will see `.gcno` files have appeared. These are the locations that could be covered.

3. Run your tests:

   `cargo test`

   In the `target/debug/deps/` dir you will now also see `.gcda` files. These contain the hit counts on which of those locations have been reached. Both sets of files are used as inputs to `grcov`.

### Generate a coverage report from coverage artifacts

Generate a html coverage report like this:

```sh
grcov . -s . --binary-path ./target/debug/ -t html --branch --ignore-not-existing -o ./target/debug/coverage/
```

N.B.: The `--binary-path` argument is only necessary for source-based coverage.

You can see the report in `target/debug/coverage/index.html`.

(or alternatively with `-t lcov` grcov will output a lcov compatible coverage report that you could then feed into lcov's `genhtml` command).

#### LCOV output

By passing `-t lcov` you could generate an lcov.info file and pass it to genhtml:

```sh
genhtml -o ./target/debug/coverage/ --show-details --highlight --ignore-errors source --legend ./target/debug/lcov.info
```

LCOV output should be used when uploading to Codecov, with the `--branch` argument for branch coverage support.

#### Coveralls output

Coverage can also be generated in coveralls format:

```sh
grcov . --binary-path ./target/debug/ -t coveralls -s . --token YOUR_COVERALLS_TOKEN > coveralls.json
```

#### grcov with Travis

Here is an example of .travis.yml file for source-based coverage:

```yaml
language: rust

before_install:
  - curl -L https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/releases/latest/download/grcov-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 | tar jxf -

matrix:
  include:
    - os: linux
      rust: nightly

script:
    - rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
    - export RUSTFLAGS="-Zinstrument-coverage"
    - cargo build --verbose
    - LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="your_name-%p-%m.profraw" cargo test --verbose
    - ./grcov . --binary-path ./target/debug/ -s . -t lcov --branch --ignore-not-existing --ignore "/*" -o lcov.info
    - bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -f lcov.info
```

Here is an example of .travis.yml file:

```yaml
language: rust

before_install:
  - curl -L https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/releases/latest/download/grcov-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 | tar jxf -

matrix:
  include:
    - os: linux
      rust: nightly

script:
    - export CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0
    - export RUSTFLAGS="-Zprofile -Ccodegen-units=1 -Copt-level=0 -Clink-dead-code -Coverflow-checks=off -Zpanic_abort_tests -Cpanic=abort"
    - export RUSTDOCFLAGS="-Cpanic=abort"
    - cargo build --verbose $CARGO_OPTIONS
    - cargo test --verbose $CARGO_OPTIONS
    - |
      zip -0 ccov.zip `find . \( -name "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME*.gc*" \) -print`;
      ./grcov ccov.zip -s . -t lcov --llvm --branch --ignore-not-existing --ignore "/*" -o lcov.info;
      bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -f lcov.info;
```

### Alternative reports

grcov provides the following output types:

| Output Type `-t` | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lcov (default)   | lcov's INFO format that is compatible with the linux coverage project.    |
| ade              | ActiveData\-ETL format. Only useful for Mozilla projects.                 |
| coveralls        | Generates coverage in Coveralls format.                                   |
| coveralls+       | Like coveralls but with function level information.                       |
| files            | Output a file list of covered or uncovered source files.                  |
| covdir           | Provides coverage in a recursive JSON format.                             |
| html             | Output a HTML coverage report, including coverage badges for your README. |

### Hosting HTML reports and using coverage badges

The HTML report can be hosted on static website providers like GitHub Pages, Netlify and others. It
is common to provide a coverage badge in a project's readme to show the current percentage of
covered code.

To still allow adding the badge when using a static site host, grcov generates coverage badges and
a JSON file with coverage information that can be used with <https://shields.io> to dynamically
generate badges.

The coverage data for <htttps://shields.io> can be found at `/coverage.json` and the generated
bagdes are available as SVGs at `/badges/*svg`.

The design of generated badges is taken from `shields.io` but may not be updated immediately if there
is any change. Using their endpoint method is recommended if other badges from their service are
used already.

#### Example

Let's consider we have a project at with username `sample` and project `awesome` that is hosted with
GitHub Pages at `https://sample.github.io/awesome`.

By using the the `shields.io` endpoint we can create a Markdown badge like so:

```md
[![coverage](https://shields.io/endpoint?url=https://sample.github.io/awesome/coverage.json)](https://sample.github.io/awesome/index.html)
```

If we want to avoid using `shields.io` as well, we can use the generated badges as follows (note
the different URL for the image):

```md
[![coverage](https://sample.github.io/awesome/badges/flat.svg)](https://sample.github.io/awesome/index.html)
```

## Auto-formatting

This project is using pre-commit. Please run `pre-commit install` to install the git pre-commit hooks on your clone. Instructions on how to install pre-commit can be found [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

Every time you will try to commit, pre-commit will run checks on your files to make sure they follow our style standards and they aren't affected by some simple issues. If the checks fail, pre-commit won't let you commit.

## Build & Test

Build with:

```sh
cargo build
```

To run unit tests:

```sh
cargo test --lib
```

To run integration tests, it is suggested to use the Docker image defined in tests/Dockerfile. Simply build the image to run them:

```sh
docker build -t marcocas/grcov -f tests/Dockerfile .
```

Otherwise, if you don't want to use Docker, the only prerequisite is to install GCC 7, setting the `GCC_CXX` environment variable to `g++-7` and the `GCOV` environment variable to `gcov-7`. Then run the tests with:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Minimum requirements

- GCC 4.9 or higher is required (if parsing coverage artifacts generated by GCC).
